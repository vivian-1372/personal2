      <description>Link Overview February 2022
Note: I wrote this paper for Government 1372: Political Psychology, a data science in the Harvard Government department. At this point, I was gaining proficiency in R, but had not developed a sophisticated understanding of statistics and causal inference yet. That said, this paper was one of my first large data science projects, and was driven by my newfound passion for applying data science techniques and programming experience to (what I deem to be) relevant real-world problems.</description>
