      <description>Link Introduction For this week’s blog post, I look at the performance of my six selected cooperation strategies when played in a repetitive, round-robin style tournament and what the results may suggest about cooperation between humans. I select appeaser, foolMeOnce, majorityScrounger, retaliater, titfortat, and winStayer as playing strategies and set them against each other over 100 repeated rounds each.
