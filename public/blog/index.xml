      <description>Link Overview February 2022
Note: I wrote this paper for Government 1372: Political Psychology, a data science in the Harvard Government department. At this point, I was gaining proficiency in R, but had not developed a sophisticated understanding of statistics and causal inference yet. That said, this paper was one of my first large data science projects, and was driven by my newfound passion for applying data science techniques and programming experience to (what I deem to be) relevant real-world problems.</description>

      <description>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.</description>
